BMI and BMR calculator
A short application that provides an API that allows you to calculate: 
*BMI (body mass index) - allows you to determine whether your weight is appropriate in relation to your height, 
*BMR / PPM (basic metabolism) - allows you to estimate the daily caloric requirement (how many calories a day should we eat).
